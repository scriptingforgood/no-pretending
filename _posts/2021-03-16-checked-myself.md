**A year of no meat (no pork, no beef, no chicken) as well as occasional fasting 24 to 50 hours** (read upon Schennikov's book about Healing Abstinence), October 2019 - till the end of 2020. 
It's been more cold than usual. The book says that cold-resistence starts on the 2nd day and forth. As the regular dry fast is usually 72h+, I haven't done that long myself to say for sure. 

The thought in mind was about less suffering and more satisfaction to animal lives. Contemporary industrial farming is scary in many countries, there should be better conditions for animals, as well as alternative food/energy sources available.
