Often times there is a huge desire for me not to only explore, but to expirement with, to travel several paths at once. 
At once I live one life. 
Unless.. Books? TV shows? Poems? 
Beings, their stories. 
Prayers, Nature and Meditation.. They do integrate in my life neatly. 
However, the times I try to get something while mixing all kinds of methods and checking about the direction with so many sources. 
Memory likes when you come back to the same thing just under different circumstances. 
The path is one. And it's tested under all conditions.
