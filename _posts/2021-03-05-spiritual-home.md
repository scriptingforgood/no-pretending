from the 1st post on direction and it's discernment: [post](https://scriptingforgood.github.io/no-pretending/2021-03-16-direction)

I think that there should be feedback, human interaction there. Someone capable to listen, someone to give a good advice. 

So far: 
### Buddhists: listened to TNH. 
Temples were accessible while I was in China. Churches - not so much. 
Community? Online mostly for the English speaker. 

### Protestants 
Anabaptists, Baptists - only read a little bit about them. Looks like the most amazing bunch, actually. Tend to be workaholics somehow. 
Don't seem to have a way for contemplative people, very actionable. 

### On UU, my current experience
Offline: I've been once in Chicago Suburbs while visiting my relatives. 

Online: 
1. I've found Utica! And following Utica's mailing list. Time difference though - 11pm+ on Sunday for me, not the greatest time for a coffee hour. 
2. That's it. There is also more widespread online community. From UUWorld, to FB and Reddit. 

### Catholics and Jesuits
When I've searched Buddhist prayers (around 2019) - Jesuit prayers were what I found. 
I've searched in English, no wonder.
