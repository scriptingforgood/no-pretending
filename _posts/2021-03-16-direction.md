1. Spiritual home. 
(UU - exist only in certain countries. Buddhism? Also in a few countries. Catholic - exist in almost all countries with freedom of expression).  Where **compassionate dialogue** is possible. 
Community? Society? Congruent role in the society. 

2. Physical location that I can call home? Can be the same as spiritual home. 
Belarus? China? (Not much of a migrant nation) North America? South America? 

3. Vocation. 
My (additional to the work for a living?) company (project?). That what I thought before. To have significant shares for influence to help some individuals, or community, organization, society. 

An ideal? The project/company that would... be nice to work for, it would be a stepping stone. Other people can also have shares in it. It also can serve as a refuge: work, earn credibility. Build skills, confidence. 
Digital project (or company), it seems. 
My role? Usually: show up ~ Be prepared ~ 

Checking out my current gravity: some relationships, my passport (can be abandoned for a better citizenship), not much belongings on my name, English language (that's the hardest to change)

### How do I fill my days at the moment? 
- Exercises and/or meditation. Done it for ages. Currently doing Tai Chi sometime, as a socially acceptable (well formalized) exercising routine in parks. Also, because it helps my stiff hip joints. 
- Prayers, expressing (ideas, talking out) and/or journaling. 
- Connecting: writing to people, asking questions. 

- Checking in with nice poems, songs, quotes, music pieces. 
- Playing with IT tools: blogging platforms, analytics (like Google Trends). 

Current prayers: for discernment, better decisions, enough wisdom, courage and integrity for better critical (serious) life decisions. 
For proper society. Additionally, for healing and being healed when it's needed to be (almost mantra). 
Sincere gratitude: internal peace - peaceful moments, joyful moments, good communication.

Values (and desire) internal: life satisfaction, to have DIRECTION in life, good interactions. Guidance (for the role in society), belonging. Chances over and over (I could have made a better turn somewhere already..)

Values external: for beings and all kinds of species to have their way ~
