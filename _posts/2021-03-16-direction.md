1. Spiritual home. 
(UU? Buddhism? Catholic) Where **compassionate dialogue** is possible. 
Community? Society? Congruent role in the society. 

2. Physical location that I can call home? Can be the same as spiritual home. 
Belarus? China? (Not a migrant nation) US? Argentina? 

3. Vocation. 
My (additional to the work for a living?) company (project?). That what I thought before. To have significant shares for influence to help some individuals, or community, organization, society. 

The project/company would... be nice to work for, it would be a stepping stone. Other people can also have shares in it. It also can serve as a refuge: work, earn credibility. Build skills, confidence. 
Digital project (or company), it seems. 
My role? Usually: show up ~ Be prepared ~ 

Checking out my current gravity: some relationships, my passport (can be abandoned for a better citizenship), not much belongings on my name, English language. 

Could be online marketing? Online brand building? As I play with blogging platforms and IT tools often. 
Via writing, storytelling. Adding some pics here and there. 

### How do I fill my days at the moment? 
- Exercises and/or meditation. Done it for ages. Currently doing Tai Chi, as a socially acceptable (well formalized) exercising routine in parks. Also, because it helps my stiff hip joints. 
- Prayers, expressing (ideas, talking out) and/or journaling. 
- Connecting: writing to people, asking questions. 

- Checking in with nice poems, songs, quotes, music pieces. 
- Playing with IT tools: blogging platforms, analytics (like Google Trends). 

Current prayers: for discernment, better decisions, enough wisdom, courage and integrity for better critical (serious) life decisions. 
For proper society. Additionally, for healing and being healed when it's needed to be (almost mantra). 
Sincere gratitude: internal peace - peaceful moments, joyful moments, good communication.

Values (and desire) internal: life satisfaction, to have DIRECTION in life, good interactions. Guidance (for the role in society), belonging. Chances over and over (I could have made a better turn somewhere already..)

Values external: for other beings and all kinds of species to have their way ~
