Besides beings having a way to live a satisfying life (and have a good transition, or finale, as is death), 
there is something that aspires. 

Containing all of the ways that beings around have (beings that include all kinds of species!) - build a coherent society (or many!). Society that is capable of achieving new grounds (perhaps, settling on other planets), and is capable to evolve, as well as (in spite of all!) prioritising virtues and love. Perhaps tough love (that is supportive and preserves the dignity of the being). 

### What wakes up your instincts, fascinates, and that is also healing? 
For me it's 
- Exercising, if not alone - under supervision in a group setting. 
- Podcast: Tim Ferris interviews and the guests of the show; Jason Gaddis on Relationships. Before (until 2019) it was Personality Hacker podcast. 
- Having a nice talk about life, one's goals, or just have a quality time together (including learning, achieving, going through tasks, or simply restoring and getting refreshed).
