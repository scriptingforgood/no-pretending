### Learning to quit the fun way 
*Walking on eggshells NOT.*

NOt being afraid to..
- Continue ask for help; 
- Continue interact with people and meet new folks. 

### Learning to find a new project 
Where? 
- Agencies: worked well previously for me as a foreigner in China. 
- Job boards: worked so so, often unfocused search because of how many different opportunities it shows. And I need just one at a time. 

What to look for? Personal example: 
- Community, feedback, possibility of growth. 
- Values. 

Decision, discernment. Clarity!
